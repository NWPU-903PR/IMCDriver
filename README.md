# IMCDriver
Identifying Driver Genes for Individual Patients through Inductive Matrix Completion


## Hardware configuration
```
RAM: 16 GB
```
The code requires a good amount of RAM.


## Software requirements
- Python 3.6
- pandas 0.22.0
- numpy 1.14.6
- scikit-learn 0.23.2

## Usage Example
- create a folder named 'IMCDriver' in your computer
- Download "data.7z", "data_preprocess.py", "IMC_with_LOOCV.py" to the "IMCDriver" 
- Unzip the data.7z to the "IMCDriver"
- set the variable cancer_folder='Example' in "data_preprocess.py", "IMC_with_LOOCV.py"
- Run the command 'python data_preprocess.py' in the Terminal to start the data pre-procession, or directly run the script of "data_preprocess.py" in the Pycharm IDE, which may take several minutes.
- After that, run the command "python test_with_LOOCV.py" in the Terminal to implement IMC with LOOCV test method, or directly run this file in the Pycharm IDE.

Note that, before running this script, you should run the script of data_preprocess.py to prepare the data for IMC. This may take tens of minutes to test all the samples. Exact time mainly depends on your computer and the number of samples in your dataset. The processing time that each sample takes will be printed to facilitate the estimation of running time.


## Data organization

The data.7z contains the following directories and files

```
Additional_file5_reliable_interactions.txt: the gene correlation network file.

NCG_known_711.txt: the list of 711 known driver genes.

Example: an directory contains the Example files.

BRCA: an directory contains the cancer BRCA dataset.

HNSC: an directory contains the cancer HNSC dataset.

LUAD: an directory contains the cancer LUAD dataset.

LUSC: an directory contains the cancer LUSC dataset.

PRAD: an directory contains the cancer PRAD dataset.

```

The directory of each cancer dataset is identically organized as follows,

```
mut_similarity: saving the file of Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity between mutated genes.

orig_data: saving the RNA-seq.txt and SomaticMutation.txt file downloaded from TCGA by Xena.
 
results: saving the file predicted by IMCDriver consisting of scores of mutated genes of each patient in the cancer dataset.
 
sample_similarity: saving the file of Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity between samples.
```

We stronger suggest that the names of files and subfolders generated by the script of data_preprocess.py not to be changed. Unless the names of changed files or subfolders are also changed identically in the script "python test_with_LOOCV.py".
